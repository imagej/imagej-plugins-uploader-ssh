/**
 * A conditional JUnit test for uploading via SSH/SFTP.
 * 
 * This test is only activated iff the following system properties are set:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>ssh.test.url</dt>
 * <dd>The URL of the update site</dd>
 * <dt>ssh.test.host</dt>
 * <dd>The SSH host of the update site</dd>
 * <dt>ssh.test.upload-directory</dt>
 * <dd>The upload directory on the SSH host corresponding to the URL of the
 * update site</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * The given SSH host <b>must</b> have a section in $HOME/.ssh/config defining
 * user name and private key.
 * 
 * Any files in the given directory will be deleted before running the test!
